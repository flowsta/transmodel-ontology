# Transmodel Ontology

Welcome to the source code of the transmodel ontology developed along the [SNAP-project.eu](https://snap-project.eu) in order to make transport data into EU compliance.


# Purpose and scope of the vocabulary

With the ultimate goal of enabling the provision of multimodal transportation services, the EU Regulation 2017/1926 is requiring transport stakeholders to allow access to their data in specific and [standarised](http://www.transmodel-cen.eu/) data formats (i.e., NeTEx, SIRI) 

Currently, the requested data formats are rarely used, thus a data conversion is needed. Particularly *Transmodel Data Model* reflection in NeTEx can be driven by the [SNAP](https://www.snap-project.eu) solution which supports data conversion in different scenarios, decreasing the time required to perform it and hiding its complexity. 

Thanks to Pieter Colpaert, in the context of work in a CEN Transmodel working group, the base URI https://w3id.org/transmodel/terms# was reserved and eventually our development has been already published.

# Development phases

The material generated in the different activities carried out during the development of the vocabulary, use cases, user stories, glossary of terms, etc., is available in the [Vocabulary Wiki](https://github.com/oeg-upm/transmodel-ontology/wiki)

# Project maintenance

To manage those incidents or suggested improvements with respect to the vocabulary, we recommend you to follow the guides provided in [Issues Management](https://github.com/oeg-upm/transmodel-ontology/wiki/issues-management) to generate an issue (work in progress never ends)

# Examples

There will be some [queries](#) will be performed in a SPARQL endpoint to test and exemplify its operability. That's awesome!
